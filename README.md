# idm-domains-backend

## Getting started

**Pre-requisites**:

- golang 1.20 (not `gcc-go`)
- docker or podman (>4.0.0)
- docker-compose or podman-compose
- python3
- openshift client [Installing OpenShift Client](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html#installing-openshift-cli).

Packages for fedora 37:

```sh
$ sudo dnf upgrade
$ sudo dnf install git golang podman podman-compose
$ sudo dnf remove gcc-go
```

(Optional) Installing VSCode by repository on fedora 37:

```sh
$ sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
$ cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/vscode.repo
[code]
name=Visual Studio Code
baseurl=https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/vscode
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
EOF
$ sudo dnf check-update
$ sudo dnf install code
```

(Optional) Recomended extensions for vscode:

- Go (highly recommended)
- REST Client
- 42Crunch OpenAPI

Once tasks:

- Install used tools: `make install-tools`
- Create your `configs/config.yaml` file: `cp -vf configs/config.example.yaml configs/config.yaml`
- Create your `secrets/private.mk` file: `cp -vf scripts/mk/private.example.mk secrets/private.mk`
- Follow the instructions in `secrets/private.mk` to set up Quay repository
  and Red Hat Repository access.
- Create your `configs/bonfire.yaml` file: `cp -vf configs/bonfire.example.yaml configs/bonfire.yaml`
- Add a `GITHUB_TOKEN` to `~/.config/bonfire/env` if deploying frequently at ephemeral environment,
  to avoid API access rate limit.

> Directory `secrets/` is set to be ignored by git and docker.

- Build by: `make build`
- Launch tests by: `make test`
- Lint code by: `make lint`
- Start local infrastructure by: `make compose-up`
- Run by: `make run`
- Stop local infrastructure by: `make compose-down`
- Clean local infrastructure by: `make compose-clean`
- Print out useful rules by: `make help`

For ephemeral environment look at: [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) file.

## Architecture and Design docs

See: [Architecture and design](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Design API

You can design your API importing the `public.openapi.yaml` file
at [api-designer](https://console.redhat.com/application-services/api-designer/designs)
at [console.redhat.com](https://console.redhat.com).

When you have made your changes, then do click **Actions** > **Download Design**,
and copy the downloaded file as `api/public.openapi.yaml`.

Now from the base of the repository now update code generated by `make generate-api`.

Finally, edit your source code to adapt to the changes (if necessary)
and update your unit tests to cover new code and update to the changes.

## Aknowledgements

Thanks to all mates from hmscontent (content-sources), without all of you
this would not be possible; every moment at hmscontent has been adding
a grain of sand to build the path on this repository.

Big thanks to everybody.
