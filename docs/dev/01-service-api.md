# Service API

## Configurations

All the configuration is centralized at `internal/config/` package.

- Keep in mind that for using environment variables, you need to
  add the field into the set defaults function, otherwise it won't
  be mapped. This is important because the EE will use the values
  in form of environment variables, however the local environment
  will map form `configs/config.yaml` file.
- The mapping between the Config structure and the environment variables
  is made automatically by viper.

## How it is implemented into the POC

- Application has every service to run in the background
  (understanding by service some background process, or
  a http listener).
  - Each service to run in the background implements the
    `ApplicationService` interface (it is not restricted to
    http endpoints).
  - The shutdown is synced by using context.
  - For API services, it configures an echo router and start
    to service the http responses.
  - For the Kafka consumer, start a golang function which subscribe
    to the kafka broker and the necessary topics.
- The http services, configure routing by adding the router
  configuration at: `internal/infrastructure/router/router.go` file.
  - This is the component that set up the configuration for the
    service API.
  - Here we set up middlewares and the http handlers for a method
    and path.
  - echo framework support middleware at global, group and handler
    level:
    - **Global** middlewares impact to all the handlers. They can be
      set for pre-routing (the route of the request was not matched
      yet) or post-routing (the route was matched). On this category
      is important middlewares to trim the trailing slash '/' (pre-routing),
      lecho middleware to write a trace for every request received, or
      request-id middleware.
    - **Group** middlewares impact a group of handlers; private and
      public handlers are organized on this way, so a set of middlewares
      are applied for public handlers (such as enforce X-Rh-Identity).
    - **Handler** middleware impact only on the handler where it is
      indicated. They are not used currently into this Proof of Concept.

API Groups:

- The API groups are splited on **public** and **private** ones
  (and **metrics** when they will be integrated, in a separate service
  and additional echo framework instance).
- Each API group has its own openapi specification yaml file.

  - **Internal** group hold the private api that is not part of our
    service api, and it is not exposed on the API gateway.
    - `/private/healthz` and `/private/livez` are used for the kubernetes
      pod lifecycle; defined at `api/internal.openapi.yaml` file (probably
      `private.openapi.yaml` is a better name for this).
    - `/metrics` will be used for exposing the metrics endpoint, it
      will be defined at `api/metrics.openapi.yaml`.
    - `/api/idmsvc/vX/todo` is defined at `api/public.openapi.yaml`; this will
      define our service API.

The code generated from the openapi specification:

- It is generated one directory per file at `internal/api` directory.
- `server.gen.go`
- `spec.gen.go`: Contains a compressed binary copy of the openapi
   spefecification. It will help on the `/api/idmsvc/v1/openapi.json`
   endpoint, which is required.
- `type.gen.go`: Contains the data structures matching the schemas
  defined into the openapi specification file.

For each resource we will find the following different components:

- **Interactor**: the responsibility of this component is to translate
  from API types to model types.
- **Repository**: the responsibility of this component is to deal with
  the data modle stored into the database (using gorm for the databse abstraction).
  This basically implements the CRUD operations related with a resource.
  - Every repository method has as first argument the database connecter, the
    decision to pass this as a parameter and not store as a field for the
    specific structure is because to manage transaction level with the database,
    it needs to be managed from the caller to this methods, so it will be the
    application handler which will manage the transation lifecycle.
  - It is made in this way to allow to combine several repositories if it were
    necessary for some specific handler.
- **Presenter**: the responsibility of this component is to translate from
  the resulting data model after execute the business logic to the API response.

> The granularity of the above three components would be per API resource,
> so that if we had `/api/idmsvc/v1/domains`, we will repeat the above 3 components
> for the `/domains` resource.

> it is missed to add common presenters for the error responses.

Said the above, we need a `handler` that combines to define the business logic
of the operations; the `handler` component will govern the interaction with the
above components and interactions with third parties as it could be.

### Ey wait, don't you generate the http handler code with the `oapi-generator` tool?

> Ok, let's speak about the generated code.

- The service api generated code is stored at `internal/api/` directory, spliting
  each openapi in a directory.
- For each openapi file it is generated the files below:
  - **types.gen.go**: It holds all the types (parameters and schemas) defined at
    the openapi schema.
  - **server.gen.go**: It holds the code for specific http framework, wrapping
    our handler once the input parameters have been bound to the type structs,
    and call `our application handler` which implement the Service interface
    (this is confusing and I have to change the naming of the services that the
    Application instance instantiate and the Service that generate the
    `oapi-generator` tool, open to suggested name for Application Service
    Interface).
  - **spec.gen.go**: It holds helper code to expose the API openapi specification.
    Expose this api at `/...` (TODO Check the endpoint at console.dot platform) is
    a platform requirement. TODO not implemented on the Proof Of Concept.

- Yes, we generate a handler boilerplate that deal with the input and output
  parameters, but it does not implement the business logic.

### Let's come back to our `<Resource>Service`

- oapi-generator generate a ServerInterface interface per openapi specification.
- Our `ServerInterface` specific implementation is hold at
  `internal/handler/impl` directory.
- We create a file per openapi specification.
- We compose an application interface which is composed by all the ServiceInterface
  interfaces.
- The code at `internal/handler/impl` currently implements this `big` interface.
  > Having a look to it today, I am not happy with the initial implementation that
  > I did here; a better approach would be:
  > - Define the application interface as it is.
  > - Implement each handler interface in independently.
  > - Implement the `big application interface` as a wrapper
  >   on the specific handlers.

- For ServiceInterface interfaces, split in several files the implementation
  for the main application service api, so that each resource has its own
  file.
  - This will reduce the size of the specific implementation file and
    allow to reduce the conflicts when committing to the repository.

Implement the handler interface (<Resource>Service) at
the body, which basically do (for this poc, but not limited to the below):

- call the interactor
- make the repository or busines logic actions.
- return the reponse using the presenter.


## Design principle followed (it needs more work)

- **S**ingle **R**esponsibility **P**rincipal: This is complex to achieve
  as many times we tend to add additional functionality to the
  components. In essence, we are going to decouple the responsibility
  of the components as much as possible so the unit tests get
  simple to implement.
  When we have to implement the unit test, if it get too complex
  to implement, that use to be an indicator that we are violating
  this principle.
<!-- - **O**pen **C**lose **P**rinciple: Our components are open for extension
  and close for modifications; in golang this means, I can create a new version
  of a component by encapsulating the old one, overriding the updated methods,
  and calling the wrapped old component. Once we have created the new component
  version, we flag the old one as deprecated to inform the user it has to update
  the references. We are leaving the old component with no changes. -->
- **L**eviskov **S**ubstitution **P**rinciple: Given two components that
  implement the same interface, they can be exchanged with no impact.
  I see this aligned with the OCP, so when we have to create and updated
  version of a component, the new version can substitute the old version
  with no impact at all (in theory).
- **I**nterface **S**egregation **P**rinciple: We split the functionality per
  interfaces, and we try to create small interface implementations so that
  we do not push to implement interfaces that we don't need into the specific
  components. If a component need to combine several interfaces, we can create a new interface which
  compose several interfaces if it were necessary.
- **D**ependency **I**nversion **P**rinciple: 


## I need to add a new middleware

- Add your middleware at: `internal/infrastructure/middleware/`.
- Update the http routers at `internal/infrastructure/router/` according to
  where do you want to add your middleware (api group, global api).

## I need to expose a new port (eg for the metrics)

- Create your openapi specification.
- Add your router at: `internal/infrastructure/router/`. This configure
  the middlewares, and call the Register function that was generated
  by the `oapi-generator` tool for us.
- Implement the Service interface at: `internal/service/impl/`.
- Instantiate the service above at: `internal/infrastructure/service/impl/application.go`.
- The current implementations into the PoC could be a guidelines
  to add more endpoints.

> To synchronize and gracefully stop a Service implementation, the context

### Interface and dependencies

One pain in the neck in golang could be the cycle dependencies. When we get
one of them could be hard to fix them; I have some thoughts about it that
will prevent them.

The basic goal is to depends on interfaces and avoid to depends on specific
implementations.

On scenarios where an interface has several implementations, it seems logic
to add each implementation in an inner package; I mean, if I define
the interface at `internal/myinterface/` directory, and I have 2 implementations
for the interface, it seems logic to add the implementations at:

- `internal/myinterface/implementation1`
- `internal/myinterface/implementation2`

## Adding a new `myres` resource to my public api

- Add the data model at: `internal/domain/model/myres.go`
- Generate the migration scripts by: `make build && ./bin/db-tool new myres`
- Fill the migration scripts at: `scripts/db/migrations/`

- Add the `/myres` resource, with its parameters, schemas and its operations
  by using [API Designer](https://console.redhat.com/application-services/api-designer)
  using the file at `api/public.openapi.yaml` file.
- Update the openapi specification by exporting the design above at: `api/`.
- Generate the boilerplate by: `make generate-api`.
- Define the interfaces for the components at:
  - **Interactor** at `internal/interface/interactor/myres_interactor.go`
  - **Repository** at `internal/interface/repository/myres_repository.go`
  - **Presenter** at `internal/interface/presenter/myres_presenter.go`
- Implement the components above at:
  - **Interactor** at `internal/usecase/interactor/myres_interactor.go`
  - **Repository** at `internal/usecase/repository/myres_repository.go`
  - **Presenter** at `internal/usecase/repository/myres_presenter.go`
- Add the components to the application implementation at:
  `internal/handler/impl/application.go`
  ```golang
  type myresComponent struct {
    interactor interactor.MyResInteractor
    repository interactor.MyResRepository
    presenter  interactor.MyResPresenter
  }
  type application struct {
    ...
    myres myresComponent
    ...
  }
  func NewHandler(config *config.Config, db *gorm.DB) handler.Application {
    ...
    iMyRes := usecase_interactor.NewMyResInteractor()
    rMyRes := usecase_repository.NewMyResRepository()
    pMyRes := usecase_presenter.NewMyResPresenter()
    ...
    return &application{
      ...
      myres: myresComponent {
        interactor: iMyRes,
        repository: rMyRes,
        presenter: pMyRes,
      },
      ...
    }
  }
  ```
- Implement the handler at: `internal/handler/impl/myres_handler.go`
  - Be aware it implement methods for the same common object (currently):
  ```golang
  func (a *application)ListMyRes(ctx echo.Context, ...) error {
    // TODO Fill the logic here
    a.myres.interactor.List(...); err != nil {
      return err
    }
    tx := a.db.Begin()
    a.myres.interactor.List(db, ...); err != nil {
      tx.Rollback()
      return err
    }
    tx.Commit()
    a.myres.presenter.List(..., &output); err != nil {
      return err
    }
    return ctx.JSON(http.StatusOK, output)
  }
  ```

## I need to communicate with third party services

- Retrieve the openapi specification.
- Add a new directory at `internal/client/<service>/`.
- Generate the client proxy from the openapi specification.
- Now just use the proxy client to communicate with the third party service.
- We will need to pass through the following headers:
  - **X-Rh-Identity**: The identity header generated by the api gateway
    by using the JWT (IIRC at cs_jwt header that comes from the external
    source).
  - **X-Insights-Request-Id**: This is necessary for distributing
    tracing; Keep an eye on Open Telemetry for future changes that
    could impact on this header (or additional headers).

## I need to add a new data model or update it

**NOTE** before arrive to stage, take advantage to make changes on your
data model, but once the service is promoted to stage environment, the update
process will be more complicated, sometimes requiring two deployments
(set all the versions with the new fields and tables, a second one to remove deprecated tables and fields).

- Add your data model at `internal/infrastructure/domain/model/`.
- Add your up/down migrations `./bin/db-tool migrate new MIGRATION_NAME`.
- Edit your up/down migration scripts at: `scripts/db/migrations/` directory.
- Add your Repository interface for the CRUD operations at:
  `internal/interface/repository/` directory.
- Add your Repository implementation at:
  `internal/usecase/repository/` directory.

> Bear in mind that `compose-up` apply the migrations upto the last current version.

See: https://consoledot.pages.redhat.com/docs/dev/best-practices/db-migrations.html

## Synchronize schema changes with *ipa-hcc* project

The enrollment agent and registration service from *ipa-hcc* project are
sharing the OpenAPI schema with the backend. Shared schema components in
`api/public.openapi.yaml` are marked with the vendor extension `x-rh-ipa-hcc`.
Any time a component is modified, added, or removed, the changes must be
synchronized with `ipa-hcc`. The script `ipa-hcc/contrib/convert_schema.py`
reads the OpenAPI file and generates *ipa-hcc*'s JSON schema files.

The `x-rh-ipa-hcc` is an object with a `type` field and an optional `name`
field:

- `type` must be one of `request`, `response`, or `defs`. The `defs` schemas
  are shared definitions (`$defs`).
- `name` is an optional field. By default, the schema component name is used.

## TODOs

- Rename the Service interface at: `internal/infrastructure/
- Centralize error handling:
  - Define error types.
  - Use hmscontent custom error handler implementation as a guide.
- Add linting for sql migration scripts, and automatic fixer
  (see how hmscontent has this integrated).
