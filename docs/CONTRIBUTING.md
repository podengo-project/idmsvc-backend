## Guidelines

### Commit messages

Follow the [conventional commits guidelines][conventional_commits] to *make
reviews easier* and to make the VCS/git logs more valuable. The general
structure of a commit message is:

```
<type>([optional scope]): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

- Prefix the commit subject with one of these [_types_](https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types/blob/master/index.json):
    - `build`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`,
      `test`, `style`, `chore`.
    - You can **ignore this for "fixup" commits** or any commits you expect to be squashed.
- Append optional scope to _type_ such as `(db)`, `(inventory)`, `(client)`, â€¦:
  - `(interactor)`: Scope the change to the input adapter components.
  - `(model)`: Scope the changes to `internal/module` and `scripts/db`.
  - `(repository)`: Scope the change to the repository components.
  - `(presenter)`: Scope the change to the output adapter components.
  - `(client)`: Scope the change to the client components.
  - `(middleware)`: Scope the changes to the middleware components.
  - `(route)`: Scope the changes to the router components.
- _Description_ shouldn't start with a capital letter or end in a period.
- Use the _imperative voice_: "Fix bug" rather than "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug."
- Try to keep the first line under 72 characters.
- A blank line must follow the subject.
- Breaking API changes must be indicated by
    1. "!" after the type/scope, and
    2. a "BREAKING CHANGE" footer describing the change.
       Example:
       ```
       refactor(provider)!: drop support for Python 2

       BREAKING CHANGE: refactor to use Python 3 features since Python 2 is no longer supported.
       ```

### Automated builds (CI)
